I need a horizontal scrolling ticker component for a Next.js website. The ticker is positioned above the navigation bar and scrolls content continuously from right to left.
What To Display:
A series of static sketch illustrations of artisans working. Each sketch shows a real human figure engaged in traditional craft work. These are NOT icons. These are NOT emojis. These are detailed hand-drawn style sketches showing actual people doing actual work.
Specific Sketches Required:

A potter sitting at a pottery wheel, hands shaping wet clay
A weaver sitting at a wooden handloom, passing shuttle through threads
A blacksmith standing at an anvil, hammer raised mid-strike
A carpenter bent over wood, using a hand plane or chisel
A woman sitting with a charkha (spinning wheel), spinning cotton thread
A basket weaver sitting cross-legged, weaving reeds with hands
A tailor sitting with fabric, needle and thread in hand stitching

Each sketch must show the full figure or upper body of the person, their tool, and their material. Real human proportions. Real working postures.
Image Style:

Monochrome line-art or pencil sketch aesthetic
Documentary illustration style, like from a heritage craft book
Earthy, muted tones if using color (browns, ochres, charcoal)
Clean white or transparent background
NOT cartoon, NOT playful, NOT childish, NOT bouncy

Image Format:

Use SVG format for crisp scaling
If SVG not possible, use optimized PNG or WebP with transparent background
Each sketch should be approximately 120-150px height to fit ticker

Libraries To Use:

react-fast-marquee for the horizontal scrolling ticker
Standard Next.js Image component for optimized loading
Tailwind CSS for styling

Component Requirements:

Smooth continuous scroll from right to left
Pause on hover
Seamless loop with no visible gap
Small text label below each sketch with the craft name (e.g., "Potter", "Weaver", "Blacksmith")
Responsive height adjustment

Do NOT:

Use emoji or unicode symbols
Use cartoon illustrations
Use colorful playful graphics
Use Lottie animations
Use icon libraries like Lucide or FontAwesome
Generate bouncy or cute visuals

Image Source Approach:
Either generate realistic sketch-style illustrations using AI image generation, or use placeholder sketch images from Unsplash/Pexels filtered for "artisan sketch" or "craft illustration". The visual must look like it belongs in a documentary or heritage publication.
